Problem Description:
  A dataset (csv) is provided which consists of 7,200 records with detailed hourly (00:00 to 23:00) observations related to building energy consumption as temperature, humidity, building type, and occupancy changes. These observations are tied to 20 buildings with differing IDs, B001-B020, and the study was conducted for two full weeks. The team sets out to develop a python program capable of predicting the energy consumption of buildings under different conditions.
